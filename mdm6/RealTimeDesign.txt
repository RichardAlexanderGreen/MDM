Role: Meter
Given: 
. Energy usage-to-date is accumulating in usage register R.
. Meter M is monitoring service S.
. Service S knows that it is on transformer T.
. Transformer T knows that it is on circuit C.
When: 
. Timer signals end-of-interval.
Then:  (following code is real time)
. U2 = usage-to-date (from R).
. U1 = prior-usage-to-date.
. Interval usage = U2-U1.
. prior-usage-to-date = U2. (stored in meter's state)
. Service [S]: Meter M on service S detects usage U for interval I. [notice]
----
Role: Service [Actor S].
Action: Meter M on service S detects usage U for interval I.
. Insert usage U into service history at interval I.   [I:U]
. If usage at interval I exceeds reporting-threshold:
. . System-Monitor: Service S meter M detects excessive load L at interval I. [notice]
. Transformer [T]: Meter M on service S detects usage U for interval I. [notice]
---
Role: Transformer [Actor T].
Action: Meter M on service S detects usage U for interval I.
. Add usage U into transformer load at interval I.     [I:U+U]
. If summed-usage at interval I exceeds reporting-threshold:
. . System-Monitor: Transformer T detects excessive load L at interval I.  [notice]
. Circuit [C]: Meter M on service S on transformer T detects usage U for interval I.  [notice]
---
Role: Circuit [Actor C].
Action: Meter M on service S on transformer T detects usage U for interval I.
. Add usage U into circuit load at interval I.         [I:U+U]
. Insert usage U into service S history at interval I. [S,I:U] (mirror)
. If summed-usage at interval I exceeds reporting-threshold:
. . System-Monitor: Circuit C detects excessive load L at interval I. [notice]
. System Monitor: Meter M on service S on transformer T, circuit C detects usage U for interval I. [notice]

Role: System Monitor [Actor SM].
Action: Service S meter M detects excessive load L at interval I.
. Sink S detects excessive load L at interval I.
Action: Transformer T detects excessive load L at interval I.
. Sink T detects excessive load L at interval I.
Action: Circuit C detects excessive load L at interval I.
. Sink C detects excessive load L at interval I.
Action: Sink S detects excessive load L at interval I.
. Ring-a-ding-ding.

Simulator spawns N circuits. (event handlers)
Each circuit spawns M services. (event handlers)
Simulator fires reset event.
. Circuits respond to reset by clearing load history tables.
. Services respond to reset by clearing load history tables and reseting random load factors.
Simulator fires interval timer events:
. Services forward timer event to its meter.
. Then the flow above is triggered.
